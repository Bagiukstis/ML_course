Exercises for 2021 MSc course in Machine Learning

Content of the course include: \
• Supervised learning methods including K-nearest neighbours, decision trees, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and neural networks. \
• Unsupervised learning methods including K-means, Gaussian mixture model, hidden Markov model, EM algorithm, and principal component analysis.\
• Probabilistic graphical models, variational Bayesian methods, belief propagation, and mean-field approximation.\
• Bayesian decision theory, bias and variance trade-off, and cross-validation.\
• Reinforcement learning. 

Every Mini Module (MM) represents one lecture and there are 13 lectures in total. If there is an [x] sign, then it means that this lecture did not include any exercises. The topics are as following:
